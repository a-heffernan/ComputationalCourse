Can create different branches:
    shows you all your commands with numbers attached to them after commit
        git log
    and attached the numbers were asdf is
        git checkout asdf
then you can work locally on this new branch and decide to merge it
   switch is like checkout but you can name your new branch - here we've called it invert
       git switch -c invert
   switch on its own just switches between the different branches, so if we want to go back to the master
       git switch master
